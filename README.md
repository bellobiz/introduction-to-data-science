# Begin Your Journey

Catherine learned and applied a lot during the first two weeks of her job. She:

- Explored churn data using SQL

- Analyzed data using pandas, a Python library

- Visualized data using Matplotlib, a Python library

- Built a Machine Learning model using scikit-learn, a Python library

Now it’s your turn. By the end of the Data Science Path, you’ll be able to do all of the things that Catherine can do. We will also be adding new content every month.

Good luck and happy coding!
